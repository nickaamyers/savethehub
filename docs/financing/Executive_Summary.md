## **WHY THIS WORKS**

### **Savings vs Library Model:**

| **Category** | **Library** | **Community** | **Annual Savings** |
|-------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Personnel (16 FTE → 7 FTE) | $720,000 | $397,043 | **$322,957** |
| Property (Rent → Mortgage) | $150,000 | $80,892 | **$69,108** |
| **TOTAL SAVINGS** | -- | -- | **$392,065/year** |

### **Key Success Factors:**

✅ **Right-sized staffing** - 4 Maker Educators (not 2) provides capacity where it matters  
✅ **Cross-functional team** - ED handles operations, educators handle programming, front desk handles comms  
✅ **Diverse revenue** - No single source exceeds 30% of budget  
✅ **Proven demand** - 71,000 people served 2014-2025  
✅ **Federal compliance** - Maintains EDA grant mission through 2035  
✅ **Community support** - City, Congressman Hill, business community backing

## **THE BOTTOM LINE**

### **This is financially viable because:**
- **Ultra-lean staffing** cuts $323K from Library's bloated model
- **Property ownership** eliminates $150K annual rent
- **Diverse revenue** reduces dependency risk
- **Strong community demand** proven over 11 years
- **Federal compliance** maintained through 2035

### **This is the right thing because:**
- Federal taxpayers invested $1M for 20-year purpose (only 10 years served)
- North Little Rock community built this with local support
- Winrock acquired for $1 in 2021
- 71,000 Arkansans deserve continued access
- Community ownership honors the original mission
