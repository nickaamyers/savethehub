Dear Judy and Winrock Leadership Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Scott Shellabarger, and I'm writing on behalf of a North Little Rock community group that has been working diligently to preserve and relaunch the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub.

## Our Purpose

We have assembled a community advisory committee and developed a comprehensive plan to acquire the Innovation Hub property and continue its mission of serving our community through maker education, STEAM programming, and entrepreneurship support. We understand the Library has terminated the lease-to-own agreement, and we would very much like to discuss acquiring the property directly from Winrock to ensure this vital community asset continues serving its intended purpose.

## Our Preparation

We have been working proactively to ensure a responsible transition that honors the federal investment in this facility:

### Federal Compliance
We have been in communication with the Economic Development Administration (EDA) regarding the $1 million federal grant (Project #08-01-04368) that funded the property improvements in 2015. We recently completed a FOIA request to understand the grant requirements and federal mortgage restrictions that remain in effect through October 2035.

### Community Support
We have strong support from the City of North Little Rock for continuing the Hub's operations and mission.

### Congressional Support
We have been working with Congressman French Hill's office, which originally announced the EDA grant in 2015. His office has been engaged with EDA on our behalf regarding the property's future and the importance of maintaining the federal investment's intended purpose.

### Operational Readiness
We have a committee prepared to assume operations, continue serving the 71,000+ individuals across 20 Arkansas counties who have benefited from the Hub, and maintain the facility's economic development mission through the remainder of the federal obligation period.

## Our Proposal

We would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with Winrock's decision-makers to discuss:

### 1. Property Acquisition
Terms under which Winrock would transfer or sell the property to our community nonprofit cooperative organization.

**Our Offer:**
- **Purchase Price:** $1,250,000 (negotiated from market estimates)
- **Closing Timeline:** 90-120 days
- **Financing:** Pre-qualified with CDFIs, capital campaign in progress
- **Clean Transaction:** No contingencies, ready to close

### 2. Timeline Coordination
We are working urgently given the December 31st Library termination. We propose:
- **January 2026:** Negotiate terms and execute purchase agreement
- **February 2026:** Complete capital campaign and finalize CDFI financing
- **March 2026:** Close on property
- **April-May 2026:** Transition operations
- **June 2026:** Re-opening under community ownership

### 3. Federal Compliance
How we can work together with EDA to ensure the transfer maintains compliance with the grant requirements and federal mortgage obligations. Our cooperative structure ensures mission continuity through 2035.

### 4. Mission Continuity
Our plan to continue and expand the Hub's programming, ensuring the federal investment continues serving its intended economic development purpose through 2035 and beyond.

## Why This Matters

The Innovation Hub has served as Arkansas's premier makerspace and STEAM education facility since 2014. We believe strongly that this community asset—built with federal taxpayer dollars, local government support, business contributions, and volunteer effort—should continue serving the community that built it rather than being sold for private use.

We recognize Winrock's significant contributions to the Hub's success over the years, and we believe a community transfer represents the best outcome for all stakeholders:

- **For the Community:** Continued access to maker education and entrepreneurship resources
- **For Winrock:** A responsible exit that honors your commitment to community development
- **For EDA:** Fulfillment of the federal grant's 20-year mission requirement
- **For Taxpayers:** Preservation of the $1 million federal investment's intended purpose

## Our Financial Capacity

We are not approaching this casually. We have:

✅ **Completed comprehensive financial modeling** showing sustainable operations  
✅ **Identified CDFI financing sources** (People Trust, NFF, LiftFund)  
✅ **Developed capital campaign plan** for $300,000 down payment  
✅ **Secured City of North Little Rock interest** in supporting acquisition  
✅ **Built cooperative membership model** ensuring long-term sustainability  
✅ **Engaged Congressional support** for federal compliance facilitation  

**Year 1 Operating Budget:** $920,400  
**Revenue Model:** 44% earned income (memberships, classes, fabrication services)  
**Financial Position:** Profitable from Year 1  
**Legal Structure:** Member-owned cooperative (501c3)

## Why Community Ownership Works

### For Winrock's Mission
Winrock International's mission is "working with people in the United States and around the world to increase economic opportunity." Transferring the Hub to community ownership:

- ✅ Maintains economic opportunity in North Little Rock
- ✅ Ensures continued service to low-income and underserved communities
- ✅ Honors Winrock's community development values
- ✅ Provides positive exit narrative
- ✅ Avoids negative PR around "profiting from federal grant"

### For Federal Compliance
Our cooperative structure guarantees:

- ✅ Mission continuity through 2035 (federal requirement)
- ✅ Economic development focus (EDA grant purpose)
- ✅ Community benefit (original grant intent)
- ✅ Democratic governance (member-owned)
- ✅ Simplified EDA approval (mission-aligned transfer)

### For North Little Rock
- ✅ Preserves 71,000+ person service capacity
- ✅ Maintains 10-11 jobs (7 core + 3-4 grant-funded)
- ✅ Continues STEAM education access
- ✅ Supports entrepreneurship and economic development
- ✅ Retains community asset built with public investment

## Our Commitment

We very much hope to have the opportunity to discuss this with you directly.

Thank you for considering this proposal. The Innovation Hub has meant so much to our community, and we are committed to ensuring it continues serving North Little Rock and the broader Arkansas region for many years to come.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

**P.S.** - This is not just about saving a building. It's about honoring a decade of federal investment, preserving access to opportunity for thousands of Arkansans, and demonstrating that community-owned solutions can work. We believe Winrock's legacy with the Hub should be "returned it to the community that built it" rather than "sold it for profit after acquiring it for $1."

The community is ready. We just need the opportunity to show you how serious we are.
