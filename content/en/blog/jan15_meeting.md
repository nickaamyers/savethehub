Dear Hub Community,

Thank you to everyone who attended our first community meeting to relaunch the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub last night. Your energy, ideas, and commitment to rebuilding our maker community were truly inspiring.

## Special Thanks

We're grateful to Allen and **The Sanctuary at Argenta** for generously donating the meeting space. We also want to thank Congressman French Hill and his office representatives for attending and supporting our efforts to bring the Hub back to our community.

## Stay Updated

Documentation is continuously evolving. You can find the latest information, financial models, and project updates on our GitHub repository at [savethehub.org](https://savethehub.org). We encourage you to check back regularly as we refine our plans based on community input.

This morning, I submitted a Letter of Interest to Colliers, the listing agent, with specifics related to the EDA mortgage. I've also notified the EDA directly of our interest in taking over the property so the mortgage can stay in place.

## Next Steps - Get Involved

To move forward effectively, we're organizing volunteers into focused working groups/committees. Please take a moment to sign up and indicate which areas you'd like to contribute to:

**Volunteer Sign-Up Form:** [https://forms.gle/L8pVk9UEYDmHGPth9](https://forms.gle/L8pVk9UEYDmHGPth9)

Your participation will be crucial to making the cooperative Hub a reality.

Thank you again for your commitment to rebuilding our community's maker space. Together, we're going to continue something truly special for Arkansas.

I'll continue to send email updates as things progress,
