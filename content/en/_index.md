# A New Vision for Community Innovation

When the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub closed its doors on December 31st, 2024, it left a gap in our community. But this isn't the end—it's a new beginning.

We're acquiring the building and reopening it as a **community-owned cooperative**, ensuring the facility serves Arkansas for generations to come.

# Why Community Ownership Matters

The cooperative model creates sustainable funding through **earned income**, gives members a **voice in governance**, and ensures the Hub serves **community needs**—not grant cycles or external agendas.

**One member, one vote.** Every member has an equal voice in governance, regardless of membership tier or financial contribution.
