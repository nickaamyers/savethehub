The Arkansas Innovation Hub combines three distinct but interconnected missions: supporting makers and innovators, empowering farmers and food entrepreneurs, and fostering artists and creatives.

Our community-owned cooperative model ensures long-term sustainability while maintaining our commitment to accessible education, economic development, and community building.
