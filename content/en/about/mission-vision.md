# Mission & Vision

## Vision

We believe that the challenges of the 21st-century economy require us to do everything we can to develop, retain, and attract talent—which has always been our state's greatest asset. This demands a collaborative community approach that exposes everyone to creative possibilities in making, growing, and creating, while offering ready access to the information, resources, and instruction they need to bring their ideas to fruition.

We envision an Arkansas where, regardless of demographic identifiers or geographic location, Arkansans are learning new skills and generating innovation across technology, agriculture, business, and the arts. A place where makers and growers work side by side, where local artists find exhibition and market opportunities, and where farmers access both traditional wisdom and cutting-edge agricultural technology to build sustainable enterprises.

## Mission

The Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub is a community-owned organization dedicated to improving the lives of Arkansans by inspiring innovation and expanding opportunities across making, agriculture, and the arts.

We use tools, skills, expertise, and land to inspire students, innovators, entrepreneurs, artists, and farmers to expand the range of educational and economic opportunities for themselves, their communities, our state, and throughout the world.

## Core Approach

We have created an open environment with tools, technology, equipment, agricultural resources, and support, along with opportunities to **Learn, Build, Grow, and Create** through formal and informal programs.

### For Makers & Innovators

Our makerspace provides access to fabrication tools, prototyping equipment, and technical expertise that enable entrepreneurs and creators to develop new products, launch businesses, and explore the frontiers of technology and design.

### For Artists & Creatives

We provide studio space, exhibition opportunities, and direct market access for local artists through gallery shows, maker markets, and Arkansas-made retail opportunities. Artists find both the space to create and pathways to sustainable creative careers.

### For Farmers & Food Entrepreneurs

We support agricultural innovation through urban farming education, market gardening training, food entrepreneurship resources, and a marketplace focused exclusively on Arkansas-grown products. We connect growers with tools, knowledge, and markets to build viable agricultural enterprises.

### For Our Community

We create an accessible space open to anyone who wants to learn and participate—regardless of age, background, or experience level. Through hands-on education, collaborative projects, and shared resources, we lower barriers and create pathways for every individual to realize their potential.

## Our Impact

The result is an acceleration of innovation that leads to:

- New products and new businesses across technology and agriculture
- New works of art and thriving creative careers
- Sustainable farming enterprises and local food security
- An enhanced appreciation for what's possible when we provide the tools, land, and support for every individual to make, grow, and create

We serve as a hub where innovation meets tradition, where technology enhances agriculture, where art intersects with making, and where collaboration creates opportunities that benefit individual Arkansans and strengthen our communities throughout the state.

## Our Commitment

We remain committed to reaching beyond central Arkansas to serve communities throughout our region—bringing resources, education, and opportunities to underserved areas through mobile programs, partnerships, and accessible facilities. We believe that talent and potential exist everywhere, and we work to ensure that geography and demographics are never barriers to opportunity.
