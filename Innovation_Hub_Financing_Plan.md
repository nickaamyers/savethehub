                                                ____________
TOTAL REVENUE.................................  $  591,524
```

### **Expenditure Breakdown:**
```
PERSONNEL (16 FTE @ $45K fully loaded)........  $  720,000  (70.9%)
CAPITAL OUTLAY
  FFE - Hub...................................  $   30,000
  Hub Property Lease (to Winrock).............  $  150,000
  Subtotal Capital............................  $  180,000  (17.7%)

OPERATIONS
  Office/Janitorial...........................  $    2,800
  Events/Services.............................  $   13,650
  Systems.....................................  $    3,700
  Utilities...................................  $   28,300

  Insurance...................................  $   14,000

  Subtotal Operations.........................  $  115,660  (11.4%)
                                                ____________
TOTAL EXPENDITURES............................  $1,015,660

NET POSITION (DEFICIT)........................  $ (424,136)
```

### **CRITICAL FINDINGS:**

**🚨 PROBLEM #1: MASSIVE PERSONNEL COSTS**
- **16 FTE = 71% of budget** ($720,000)
- Library model is HEAVILY overstaffed
- Average: **$45,000 per FTE** (fully loaded)
- This is unsustainable for independent nonprofit

**🚨 PROBLEM #2: STRUCTURAL DEFICIT**
- **$424K annual deficit** covered by Library system
- Not viable for standalone operation
- Grants ($441K) barely cover personnel alone

**🚨 PROBLEM #3: RENT PAYMENT TO WINROCK**
- **$150,000 annual lease** to Winrock
- This money should go to mortgage/ownership
- Buying eliminates this expense after debt service covered

**✅ OPPORTUNITY: Operations-only costs are reasonable**
- **$116K for actual Hub operations** (utilities, maintenance, programming, insurance)
- **$28K utilities** = reasonable for 25,000 sq ft facility
- **$50K maintenance** = appropriate for building age/condition
- These costs are NOT the problem - staffing is

---

## **SECTION 2: RIGHT-SIZED STAFFING MODEL**

### **Library's 16 FTE Model (BLOATED):**

**Why 16 FTE is excessive:**
- Hub operated successfully 2014-2021 with **4-6 staff**
- Makerspaces nationally average **0.8-1.2 FTE per 5,000 sq ft**
- 25,000 sq ft = 4-6 FTE is industry standard
- Library embedded Hub staff into broader library system (inefficient)
- Many roles duplicative with library administration

### **Recommended Community Model: 6-7 FTE**

#### **STAFFING STRUCTURE:**

**1. Executive Director (1 FTE)**
- Salary: $65,000
- Benefits (30%): $19,500
- **Total: $84,500**
- **Role:** Overall leadership, fundraising, board liaison, **facilities management, operations oversight, vendor management**
- **Expanded responsibilities:** Takes on operations manager functions - typical for small nonprofit
- Experience: Nonprofit management, makerspace background, facilities experience

**2. Maker Educators / Lab Technicians (4 FTE)**
- Salary: $38,000 each
- Benefits (30%): $11,400 each
- **Total: $197,600 (4 positions)**
- **Role:** Equipment training, open lab supervision, class instruction, member support, **program development, curriculum design, partnership coordination, safety compliance**
- **Expanded responsibilities:** Cross-trained to handle programming and scheduling (former Program Manager duties)
- **Coverage:** Flexible scheduling allows 7-day operation with rotating shifts
- Experience: Technical skills (3D printing, laser cutting, CNC, electronics, woodworking) + education/facilitation skills

**3. Front Desk / Member Services Coordinators (2 FTE)**
- Salary: $32,000 each
- Benefits (25%): $8,000 each
- **Total: $80,000 (2 positions)**
- **Role:** Reception, membership management, event check-in, **grant writing support, social media, communications, website updates, donor database, newsletter**
- **Expanded responsibilities:** Handles all development/communications functions under ED supervision
- **Coverage:** M-F 9am-6pm + rotating Saturday coverage
- Experience: Customer service, admin, writing/communications skills, social media proficiency

#### **TOTAL PERSONNEL: 7 FTE**
```
Executive Director (ops + facilities)..........  $   84,500
Maker Educators (4 FTE - programs + tech)......  $  197,600
Front Desk (2 FTE - admin + comms).............  $   80,000
                                                 ___________
TOTAL PERSONNEL COSTS..........................  $  362,100

PAYROLL TAXES (7.65% FICA).....................  $   27,701
WORKERS COMP (estimated 2%)....................  $    7,242

### **STAFFING COMPARISON:**

| **Model** | **FTE** | **Cost** | **Cost per FTE** | **% Reduction** |
|-----------|---------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Library (2025)** | 16 | $720,000 | $45,000 | -- |
| **Community (Ultra-Lean)** | 7 | $397,043 | $56,720 | **45% savings** |

**Key Insight:** Slightly higher per-FTE cost but FAR fewer positions = **$323K annual savings**

### **WHY THIS WORKS:**

✅ **Lean but functional** - All essential roles covered  
✅ **Higher quality** - Better paid, more experienced professionals  
✅ **Mission-focused** - No bureaucratic overhead  
✅ **Flexible** - Can add PT instructors/contractors as programs grow  
✅ **Sustainable** - Personnel now 50% of budget, not 71%  
✅ **Proven model** - Matches successful makerspaces nationally

## **SECTION 7: CASH FLOW ANALYSIS**

### **MONTHLY CASH FLOW - YEAR 1**

**AVERAGE MONTHLY:**

**Inflows:**
```
Memberships & classes (steady)..................  $  16,917
Grants (quarterly disbursements)................  $  29,167
Donations & sponsorships (varied)...............  $   8,333
                                                  __________
Total Monthly Revenue...........................  $  54,417
```

**Outflows:**
```
Payroll (bi-weekly).............................  $  33,087
Operations......................................  $  13,333
Debt service....................................  $   6,741
                                                  __________
Total Monthly Expenses..........................  $  53,161
```

**Net Monthly Cash Flow: +$1,256**

### **CRITICAL CASH MANAGEMENT:**

**Challenges:**
- Grant payments are lumpy (quarterly or annual)
- Payroll is constant (bi-weekly)
- Must maintain 3-month operating reserve

**Solutions:**
1. **Operating Reserve:** Establish $175K reserve (3 months expenses)
2. **Line of Credit:** Secure $50K LOC for cash flow smoothing
3. **Grant Advance Requests:** Request quarterly disbursements
4. **Membership Model:** Push annual memberships (upfront cash)

---

## **SECTION 8: ACQUISITION SCENARIOS & NEGOTIATIONS**

### **SCENARIO A: WINROCK GIFT/DONATION**

**The Ask:** Winrock donates property to community nonprofit

**Winrock Benefits:**
- Tax deduction: ~$1.25M (could offset other taxable income)
- Positive PR: "Winrock returns Hub to community"
- Mission alignment: Community development organization supporting community ownership
- Federal compliance: Maintains EDA grant purpose through 2035
- Exit clean: No sale negotiations, no EDA repayment complications

**Community Benefits:**
- No debt service ($81K/year savings)
- Lower operating budget ($575K vs. $655K)
- Faster sustainability
- Maximum resources for programming

**Likelihood:** Low (but worth asking) - requires board approval for major asset gift

---

### **SCENARIO B: BELOW-MARKET SALE ($1.25M)**

**The Ask:** Winrock sells for $1.25M (below potential $2M market value)

**Rationale:**
- Federal compliance: Selling to mission-continuity buyer reduces EDA complications
- Tax benefits: Charitable component could generate partial deduction
- PR management: Avoids "nonprofit profiting from federal grant" narrative
- Fast transaction: Community buyer ready now, no contingencies
- Relationship preservation: Maintains Winrock's reputation in Arkansas

**Negotiation Points:**
- Emphasize federal grant compliance requirements
- Highlight EDA's approval process for sales (uncertainty)
- Point to community's readiness and funding secured
- Offer clean transaction (no inspections, no financing contingency)
- Include "mission preservation" covenant in deed

**Financing:** Capital Campaign ($300K) + CDFI Loan ($900K) + City Grant ($50K)

**Likelihood:** Moderate - Winrock may prefer certainty of community sale over market speculation

---

### **SCENARIO C: LEASE-TO-OWN (BACKUP PLAN)**

**The Ask:** 3-year lease-to-own with purchase option

**Terms:**
```
Monthly rent: $8,000 ($96K/year)
Rent credit: 50% toward purchase ($4,000/mo = $48K/year)
Purchase price: $1.25M (fixed)
Purchase option: Exercisable anytime, expires year 3
Down payment at purchase: $200K (reduced by rent credits)
```

**Benefits:**
- Immediate occupancy
- Time to build revenue and reserves
- Rent credits reduce ultimate down payment
- Test operational model before full purchase
- Option to walk away if infeasible (after year 1)

**Winrock Benefits:**
- Monthly income during transition
- Maintains asset ownership temporarily
- Market test for property value
- Option premium if community can't purchase

**Likelihood:** High - Winrock's current strategy, just negotiate better terms than Library had

---

## **SECTION 9: RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION**

### **RISK #1: INSUFFICIENT CAPITAL CAMPAIGN**

**Risk:** Can't raise $300K down payment in 90 days

**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** High (can't close purchase)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Pre-campaign cultivation:** Start donor conversations now
2. **Lead gift commitments:** Secure $100K before public launch
3. **Bridge financing:** Arrange $100K bridge loan from supporter
4. **Extended timeline:** Negotiate 120-day closing with Winrock
5. **Backup plan:** Lease-to-own while continuing campaign

---

### **RISK #2: GRANT FUNDING SHORTFALL**

**Risk:** Can't secure $350K annual grants

**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** High (operating deficit)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Diversification:** Target 10+ grant sources, not reliant on any single funder
2. **Multi-year commitments:** Secure 2-3 year pledges from key funders
3. **Grant consultant:** Hire professional grant writer (can pay for itself)
4. **Increased earned revenue:** If grants fall short, boost classes/memberships
5. **Expense flex:** Personnel can adjust (PT vs FT, defer hires)

---

### **RISK #3: WINROCK REFUSES TO NEGOTIATE**

**Risk:** Winrock lists at $2M, refuses community offer

**Probability:** Medium-High  
**Impact:** Critical (lose opportunity)

**Mitigation:**
1. **EDA leverage:** Work with Hill's office to pressure via EDA compliance
2. **Public pressure:** Media campaign about community ownership
3. **Competitive bid:** Raise additional capital, match market offers
4. **Legal challenge:** Explore whether EDA mortgage requires mission-continuity buyer
5. **Long game:** If Winrock sells to investor, approach new owner about lease

---

### **RISK #4: OPERATIONAL COSTS EXCEED PROJECTIONS**

**Risk:** Utilities, maintenance, or insurance higher than budgeted

**Probability:** Low-Medium  
**Impact:** Medium (operating deficit)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Conservative budgeting:** Already built in 10% contingency
2. **Facility audit:** Conduct thorough pre-purchase inspection
3. **Energy efficiency:** Invest in LED lighting, HVAC upgrades (grants available)
4. **Deferred maintenance:** Create 5-year capital plan
5. **Operating reserve:** Maintain $175K reserve for unexpected costs

### **RISK #5: INSUFFICIENT COMMUNITY SUPPORT**

**Risk:** Low membership, class enrollment below projections

**Probability:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium (revenue shortfall)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Market research:** Pre-launch survey of potential members
2. **Founding members:** Offer discounted lifetime memberships (upfront cash)
3. **Youth focus:** Partner with schools for guaranteed class enrollment
4. **Corporate partnerships:** B2B marketing, employee benefits programs
5. **Hub history:** 71,000 people served 2014-2025 proves demand exists

## **SECTION 13: WHY THIS IS BETTER THAN WINROCK SALE**

### **COMPARISON:**

| **Factor** | **Winrock Private Sale** | **Community Ownership** |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Federal Compliance** | Uncertain (10 years remain) | Guaranteed through 2035 |
| **Community Access** | Likely ends (commercial use) | Continues and expands |
| **Jobs** | Lost (7-16 positions) | Preserved (7 positions) |
| **Mission** | Ends | Continues |
| **Economic Impact** | Lost ($71K served) | Maintained |
| **Federal Investment** | Wasted ($1M for 10 years) | Fulfilled ($1M for 20 years) |
| **Winrock Reputation** | "Profited from federal grant" | "Supported community" |
| **Timeline** | Uncertain (market dependent) | Ready now |
| **EDA Approval** | Required, uncertain | Likely approved |

---

## **SECTION 14: CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **THIS PLAN IS FINANCIALLY VIABLE BECAUSE:**

1. **Right-sized staffing** reduces personnel from $720K to $413K (43% savings)
2. **Ownership eliminates rent** - $150K/year to Winrock becomes equity
3. **Diverse revenue** reduces risk - no single source over 30% of budget
4. **Conservative projections** - revenue estimates are achievable
5. **Strong demand** - 71,000 people served 2014-2025 proves market exists
6. **Community support** - City, French Hill, business community backing
7. **Federal purpose** - Maintains EDA grant mission through 2035

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:**

**THIS WEEK:**
1. ✅ Send acquisition proposal to Winrock (Judy Weishar, Lana Pyburn, Jared Olson)
2. ✅ Contact CDFIs for financing pre-approval
3. ✅ Meet with City of NLR about grant support
4. ✅ Identify capital campaign leadership donors
5. ✅ Engage Hill's office on EDA compliance leverage

**NEXT 30 DAYS:**
1. Negotiate with Winrock on price and terms
2. Secure CDFI financing commitment
3. Launch capital campaign (quiet phase)
4. Form nonprofit board
5. Develop detailed transition plan

**THE BOTTOM LINE:**

This is not just financially feasible - **it's the right thing to do.**

The Innovation Hub was built with:
- $1 million federal taxpayer investment
- North Little Rock city support
- Business community contributions
- Individual donor commitments
- Thousands of volunteer hours

**Winrock acquired it for $1 in 2021.**

**The community should own what the community built.**

This plan proves it can be done sustainably, responsibly, and in compliance with all federal obligations.

**The Hub belongs to the community. Let's bring it home.**

## **REVISION NOTES**

**December 30, 2025 - ULTRA-LEAN STAFFING MODEL**

This plan has been revised to reflect an even leaner, more sustainable staffing structure:

**KEY CHANGES:**
1. **Eliminated Operations Manager** - ED takes on facilities/operations directly (standard for small nonprofits)
2. **Eliminated Program Manager** - Maker Educators cross-trained for program development
3. **Eliminated Development Coordinator** - Front Desk staff handle communications/development support
4. **Increased Maker Educators from 2 to 4 FTE** - More resources on the floor with members

**RESULTS:**
- **Personnel: $397,043** (down from $413,380)
- **Additional savings: $16,337/year**
- **Total savings vs Library: $322,957/year (45%)**
- **More maker educators** = better member service and programming capacity
- **Leaner structure** = faster decision-making, less bureaucracy

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
- Executive Director skilled enough to handle operations + fundraising
- 4 Maker Educators provide redundancy, cross-coverage, and expertise depth
- Front desk can handle admin/comms under ED supervision
- Typical model for makerspaces under $1M annual budget
- Proven sustainable at similar-sized makerspaces nationally

**YEAR 1 BUDGET SUMMARY:**
```
Personnel....................................... $  397,043
Operations...................................... $  160,000
Debt Service ($1.25M @ 6.5%, 25 years).......... $   80,892
                                                 ___________
TOTAL ANNUAL BUDGET............................. $  637,935

Year 1 NET INCOME............................... $   17,065
```

**This model is MORE sustainable than the original 7 FTE plan while maintaining ALL essential functions.**
